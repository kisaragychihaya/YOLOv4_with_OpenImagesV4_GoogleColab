# I. Introduction

- YOLOv4 have been released on 23 Apr 2020. The new updated version of the popular YOLO object detection neural network which achieves state-of-the-art results on the MS-COCO dataset, running at real-time speed of more than 65 FPS.
- Darknet is a framework to train neural networks, it is open source and written in C/CUDA and serves as the basis for YOLO. The original repository, by J Redmon (also first author of the YOLO paper), can be found [here](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet). Darknet is used as the framework for training YOLO, meaning it sets the architecture of the network.

- Open Images Dataset v4,provided by Google, is the largest existing dataset with object location annotations with ~9M images for 600 object classes that have been annotated with image-level labels and object bounding boxes.More details about OIDv4 can be read from [here](https://medium.com/@karol_majek/open-images-dataset-v4-237fc006b094).

- The OIDv4 Toolkit is  easy to use repo allows you to download only the image categories you need, along with their bounding boxes. This is public at https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit
 
- The problem is that the difference between the label format in Open Images Dataset and the input format of Yolo model makes it a bit difficult and takes a long time to standardize.

- In this repository, I have customized and added a few features to easily standardize all data labels. It make easier to use custom data from Open Images Dataset for retraining the YOLO model.

- I used main code from https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet and https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit.

- I also give a tutorial to train YOLOv4 on google colab with this repository and custom data.

- Clone this repository

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/DucLeTrong/YOLOv4_with_OpenImagesV4_GoogleColab.git
```

## 2. Download data

### Install the required packages

Peek inside the requirements file if you have everything already installed. Most of the dependencies are common libraries.


```
cd ~/YOLOv4_with_OpenImagesV4_GoogleColab/OIDv4_ToolKit
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download different classes in separated folders

 The ToolKit can be used to download classes in separated folders. The argument --classes accepts a list of classes or the path to the file.txt. 

In this example download Person and Car from the train set. In this case we have to use the following command.

- Read more about OIDv4_ToolKit  [here](https://github.com/DucLeTrong/darknet/tree/master/OIDv4_ToolKit)

```
 python3 main.py downloader -y --classes Person Car --type_csv train --limit 100
```

## 3. Prepare data for Yolo formatting

### Making obj_name.txt file contain all classes


```
cd ~/YOLOv4_with_OpenImagesV4_GoogleColab

echo Person >> obj_name.txt
echo Car >> obj_name.txt
```

    /content/YOLOv4_with_OpenImagesV4_GoogleColab
    

### Processing data to yolo formatting and preparing training data with  process_data.py


```
python3 process_data.py --data_set_name='Train' --des_path='custom_data'
```

## 4. Config model

### I created a text file named it 'config_data.txt' containing the following:

- classes is '2' as number of classes training.

- train.txt is a single text file that lists the full directory of where each photo is that you downloaded; I created it by runing process_data.py

- test.txt; same as above and this is created along with the train.txt file.

- "backup_yolo" is just a folder where you want the trained weights files to be output to while it trains.


```
# Create config_data.txt config file
rm -rf config_data.txt
echo classes=2 > config_data.txt
echo train=train.txt >> config_data.txt
echo valid=valid.txt >> config_data.txt
echo names=obj_name.txt >> config_data.txt
echo backup=backup_yolo >> config_data.txt
```


    

### Download weights of YoloV4 pretrain from google drive


```
https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1JKF-bdIklxOOVy-2Cr5qdvjgGpmGfcbp&export=download
```



### Customize model config file

#### Copy config file


```
cp cfg/yolov4-custom.cfg yolov4-custom.txt
```

#### Edit yolov4-custom.txt file as follows: 

- Line 3: Set batch=64.

- Line 4: Set subdivisions=32, the batch will be divided by 16 or 64 depends on GPU VRAM requirements.

- Change line max_batches to classes*2000 but not less than number of training images, and not less than 6000, f.e. max_batches=6000 if you train for 3 classes.

- Change line steps to 80% and 90% of max_batches, f.e. steps=4800,5400.

- Change line classes=2 to your number of objects in each of 3: Line 970 1058 1146.

- Change [filters=255] to filters=(classes + 5)x3 in the 3 [convolutional] before each [yolo] layer, keep in mind that it only has to be the last [convolutional] before each of the [yolo] layers. Line 1139 1051 963. In this case, filters=(2 + 5)x3

#### Save that after making the changes.

## 5. Train Model
